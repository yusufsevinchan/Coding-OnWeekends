# Coding-OnWeekends

In this repository, I solve coding problems every weekend (Saturday and Sunday).

Each week will have its own folder containing the problems and their corresponding solutions.

## Structure

- Each week has a dedicated folder.
- Inside each folder, you will find the problem statements and solution files.

Feel free to fork this repository and solve the problems alongside me!
